## Overview

`cherrytree` is a library which provies a safe, simple, and correct API over a tree data structure, "`Tree`".

`Tree` has been specifically designed in such a way that *each* node inside of it can be queried with a unique key in *constant time*.
This proves highly suitable for applications where data needs to be grouped in a tree-like fashion while also being able to be retrieved as quickly as possible.
Certain popular applications include DOMs and non-cyclical solvers.

<br>

## Features

#### Immutable APIs

- Constant time access to an immutable reference to a `Node`s value, its child keys, and its optional parent key given the unique key that identifies it.

- Getting the relationship between two `Node`s in a `Tree` instance. Examples of relationships include "ancestor-descendent" and "siblings".

- Immutable iterator over the `Node`s of the `Tree` in some arbitrary order. BFS and DFS immutable iterators are planning on being supported in a future release.

#### Mutable APIs

- Constant time access to a mutable reference to a `Node`s value. This API will **not**, however, provide mutable references to its child keys and optional parent key in order to preserve the integrity of the `Tree` instance.

- Removal of a `Node` from the `Tree`. This will subsequently remove all of that `Node`s descendent `Node`s.

- Rebasing a `Node` onto another `Node` in the `Tree`. Even "unusual" rebase operations (e.g., rebasing a parent onto its descendent) are supported! More information about rebasing can be found in the docs. The [examples directory](./examples) also contains an example on how to do this.

- Reordering the child keys of a `Node`. Child keys are inserted into a `Node` in insertion-order (i.e., first come, first in). As such, the child keys can be reordered to match some new desired order.

- Mutable iterator over the `Node`s of the `Tree` in some arbitrary order. BFS and DFS mutable iterators are planning on being supported in a future release.

## Implementation
| Design | Notes |
| - | - |
| `SlotMap`-backed allocation pool | Provides constant time access to data held in the map. This is how `cherrytree` can access `Nodes` quickly. |
| | Deletions from the map will leave "holes" which can then be reused (`SlotMap` provisions a key for you, so it will provision a key which corresponds to a hole). As such, deletions do **not** require other data to be shifted down. |
| | Implements "phase-based deallocation", which means all of its memory is released only when the `Tree` is being destructed. For long-lived trees (e.g., DOMs), this can avoid unnecessary runtime deallocations. |
| `IndexSet`-backed child-key storage | ... |

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml` manifest file, substituting the `VERSION_NUMBER` variable for any real version:

```toml
[dependencies]
cherrytree = "${VERSION_NUMBER}"
```

<br>

## Examples

#### Basic

```rust
use cherrytree::{
    Node,
    Tree,
};
use slotmap::DefaultKey;

// create the tree
let mut tree = Tree::<DefaultKey, usize>::default();

// insert a root value
let root_key = tree.insert_root(0);

// insert child values
let child_key_1 = tree.insert(1, root_key).unwrap();
let child_key_2 = tree.insert(2, root_key).unwrap();
let child_key_3 = tree.insert(3, root_key).unwrap();

// get an immutable reference to the value of the first child
let child_node_1 = tree.get(child_key_1).unwrap();
assert_eq!(*child_node_1.value, 1);

// get a mutable reference to the value of the second child and update it
let child_node_2 = tree.get_mut(child_key_2).unwrap();
assert_eq!(*child_node_2.value, 2);
*child_node_2.value = 100;

// assert that the value has indeed updated
let child_node_2 = tree.get(child_key_2).unwrap();
assert_eq!(*child_node_2.value, 100);
```

#### More Examples

Further examples of programs can be found in the [examples directory](./examples).

Each example file is prefixed with a number and followed by a short explanation on what that example showcases (e.g., `1_this_example_does_xyz.rs`, `2_this_example_does_abc.rs`).
It is recommended to read through the examples in numerical order.
